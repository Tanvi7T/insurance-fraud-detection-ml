## Activity 1: Collect the Dataset:

## ✅ Activity 1.1: Importing the Libraries
Description:
To perform insurance fraud detection using machine learning, we need to import
essential Python libraries for data handling, visualization, and model building. 
Libraries such as NumPy and Pandas are used for numerical computation and data
manipulation. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data visualization. Scikit-learn 
is used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## ✅ Activity 1.2: Read the Dataset
Description (you can paste this):
The dataset is loaded using Pandas. The dataset may be in CSV, Excel, or JSON format. 
After loading the dataset, we check the basic structure such as number of rows and
columns,column names, and data types. We also check for missing values using 
isnull().sum() toensure data quality before further processing. 

## Activity 2: Data Preparation:
