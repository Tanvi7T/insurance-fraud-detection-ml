## ✅ Activity 1.1: Business Problem: Insurance Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

Insurance companies face significant financial losses due to fraudulent claims. A large number 
of claims are submitted every day, and manually verifying each claim is time-consuming, costly, 
and prone to human error. As a result, many fraudulent claims go undetected, while some genuine
claims may be delayed or wrongly flagged.
The business problem is to develop a machine learning–based system that can automatically identify
and classify insurance claims as fraudulent or genuine based on historical claim data and relevant
parameters (such as claimant details, policy information, claim amount, claim history, type of damage, etc.).

This system will help insurance companies:
Detect fraud early
Reduce financial losses
Speed up claim processing
Minimize manual investigation effort
Improve overall customer trust and operational efficiency
✨ One-line version (if they ask for a short problem statement):
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether an insurance claim is fraudulent or
genuine to reduce losses and improve claim processing efficiency.

## ✅ Activity 1.2: Business Requirements

🎯 Objective
To build an intelligent system that can automatically detect and classify insurance claims as
Fraudulent or Genuine using machine learning techniques, helping insurance companies reduce 
losses and improve claim processing efficiency.

📌 Functional Requirements
The system should be able to:
Accept insurance claim data (policy details, claim amount, claim type, claimant history, etc.).
Preprocess and clean the input data (handle missing values, encoding, normalization).
Analyze historical claim data to learn fraud patterns.
Predict whether a new insurance claim is Fraudulent or Legitimate.
Display prediction results clearly to the user (e.g., Fraud / Not Fraud).
Allow authorized users (admin/insurance officer) to view results and model performance.
Store predictions and claim records for future reference and auditing.

⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements
Accuracy – The model should achieve good prediction accuracy and low false positives.
Performance – The system should give predictions in real-time or near real-time.
Scalability – Should handle a large number of claims.
Security – Claimant data must be protected and access should be restricted.
Reliability – The system should work consistently without frequent failures.
Usability – The interface should be simple and user-friendly.

📊 Data Requirements
Claim ID
Policy ID
Claim amount
Claim type
Date of claim
Claimant history
Number of previous claims
Accident/damage details
Label (Fraud / Not Fraud)

🚧 Constraints
Availability of quality historical data
Imbalanced dataset (fraud cases are fewer than genuine ones)
Legal and privacy regulations
Time and resource limitations

📈 Success Criteria
Improved fraud detection rate
Reduction in manual investigation workload
Faster claim processing time
Lower financial losses due to fraud

## ✅ Activity 1.3: Literature Survey (Insurance Fraud Detection Using ML)
Several researchers and industry practitioners have explored the use of Machine Learning (ML)
techniques to detect insurance fraud. Traditional rule-based systems were widely used earlier,
but they fail to adapt to new fraud patterns and often produce a high number of false positives.
Recent studies show that supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision 
Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting are effective in 
identifying fraudulent insurance claims. Among these, ensemble methods like Random Forest and
XGBoost provide higher accuracy and better generalization because they combine multiple decision models.
Researchers have also highlighted the challenge of imbalanced datasets, where fraudulent claims
are much fewer compared to genuine ones. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling 
Technique), cost-sensitive learning, and anomaly detection methods are used to address this issue.
In addition, deep learning approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are explored for
complex patterns in large-scale insurance datasets. Feature engineering and data preprocessing play
a crucial role in improving model performance. Evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, 
and ROC-AUC are preferred over simple accuracy due to the imbalance in fraud data.
Overall, the literature suggests that machine learning-based fraud detection systems significantly
improve detection rates, reduce manual effort, and adapt better to evolving fraud strategies compared to traditional methods.
