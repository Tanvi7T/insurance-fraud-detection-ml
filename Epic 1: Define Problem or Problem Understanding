**Social Impact:**  
This Insurance Fraud Detection project helps reduce fraudulent insurance claims, 
which protects honest customers from higher premiums and improves trust in insurance systems. 
By identifying suspicious claims early, the system supports fair treatment of policyholders 
and helps insurance companies allocate resources more effectively.

**Business Impact:**  
The model can help insurance companies reduce financial losses caused by fraud, speed up claim
processing, and improve operational efficiency. Automating fraud detection reduces manual review 
time, lowers investigation costs, and enables faster decision-making, leading to improved customer 
satisfaction and profitability.
