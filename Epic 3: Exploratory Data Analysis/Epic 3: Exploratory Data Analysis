## 1. Univariate Analysis
Purpose: Understand individual feature distributions and detect data quality issues.
Deliverables:
Distribution of target variable (Fraud vs Non-Fraud)
Descriptive statistics for numerical features
Frequency distributions for categorical features
Identification of skewed variables and class imbalance

2. Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
Purpose: Analyze relationships between features and the target variable.
Deliverables:
Correlation matrix / heatmap for numerical variables
Analysis of key relationships (e.g., claim amount vs fraud, policy type vs fraud)
Identification of potentially informative predictors
Visual comparisons across classes (Fraud vs Non-Fraud)

3. Visual Analysis
Purpose: Support insights using appropriate visualizations.
Deliverables:
Histograms and box plots for numerical features
Count plots for categorical features
Identification of outliers and unusual patterns
Visual evidence of feature relevance

4. Handling Categorical Variables
Purpose: Prepare categorical features for modeling.
Deliverables:
Identification of nominal and ordinal features
Encoding strategy (One-Hot Encoding / Label Encoding as appropriate)
Transformed dataset with encoded features
Documentation of encoding decisions

5. Feature Scaling
Purpose: Normalize numerical features to ensure stable model performance.
Deliverables:
Selection of scaling method (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)
Comparison of feature distributions before and after scaling
Scaled dataset for model input

6. Insights & Recommendations
Purpose: Summarize findings to guide model building.
Deliverables:
Key patterns and trends observed
Features showing strong association with fraud
Data issues identified (outliers, imbalance, skewness)
Recommendations for feature selection and model strategy
