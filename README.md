# Insurance Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Insurance companies lose a lot of money due to fraudulent claims.  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can detect whether an insurance claim is fraudulent or genuine based on given features.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the problem of insurance fraud detection  
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Train machine learning models to classify fraud vs non-fraud  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics  

## 🧠 Workflow

1. **Problem Understanding**  
   Understand the business problem of insurance fraud detection and define the objective: classify claims as fraudulent or genuine.

2. **Data Collection**  
   Obtain the insurance claims dataset from the provided source.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Scale numerical features  
   - Remove duplicates/outliers if any  

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze feature distributions  
   - Visualize relationships between features and fraud labels  
   - Identify class imbalance  

5. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Select important features  
   - Create new useful features if required  

6. **Model Building**  
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  

7. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
   - Use confusion matrix  

8. **Model Optimization**  
   - Tune hyperparameters  
   - Compare multiple models  

9. **Results & Conclusion**  
   - Select best performing model  
   - Summarize insights and business impact  

10. **Deployment / Future Scope (Optional)**  
   - Discuss how the model can be used in real insurance systems  
   - Mention future improvements
