# Insurance Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Insurance companies lose a lot of money due to fraudulent claims.  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can detect whether an insurance claim is fraudulent or genuine based on given features.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the problem of insurance fraud detection  
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Train machine learning models to classify fraud vs non-fraud  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics  

## 🧠 Workflow
1. Define the business problem  
2. Collect and understand the dataset  
3. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Model building (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
6. Model evaluation  
7. Result analysis and conclusion
