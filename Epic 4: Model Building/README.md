## ⚙️ Models Implemented (Epic 4: Model Building)

- **Decision Tree**  
  Builds a tree-like structure based on feature splits to classify fraud and non-fraud cases.

- **Random Forest**  
  Ensemble of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  Classifies claims based on similarity with nearest data points.

- **Logistic Regression**  
  Predicts probability of fraud using a binary classification approach.

- **Naive Bayes**  
  Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem with feature independence assumption.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
  Finds the optimal boundary to separate fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims.

## 📊 Model Evaluation  

Models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC Score  

> Since fraud datasets are usually imbalanced, Recall and F1-score are considered more important than Accuracy.
