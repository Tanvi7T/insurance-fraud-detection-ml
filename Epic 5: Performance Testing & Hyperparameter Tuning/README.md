### 🔁 Model Comparison
The performance of all models was compared to:

- Understand strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm  
- Select the most suitable model for fraud detection  
- Observe trade-offs between precision and recall  

---

### ⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning 
To improve model performance, hyperparameter tuning was applied
to selected models using techniques such as:

- GridSearchCV  
- Cross-validation  

This helped optimize model parameters and improve prediction
performance.

---

### ✅ Outcome
The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation
metrics and comparison results.  
This model will be used in the deployment phase of the project.
