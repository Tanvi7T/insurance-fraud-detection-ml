## Description 
Performance Testing is used to evaluate how well different machine learning
models perform on unseen (test) data. In this epic, the trained models such
as Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and
SVM are tested using evaluation metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall,
and F1-score. These metrics help in understanding how correctly the model
predicts fraudulent and non-fraudulent insurance claims, especially in the
presence of class imbalance.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
It is the process of improving model performance by adjusting important
model parameters such as:
max_depth, min_samples_split in Decision Tree
n_estimators, max_depth in Random Forest
n_neighbors in KNN
C, kernel in SVM
The model performance before and after hyperparameter tuning is compared
to observe improvements in accuracy and F1-score. This comparison helps
in selecting the best-performing model for deployment.

## 📌 Short Version
Performance testing is done to evaluate multiple machine learning models
using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on test 
data. Hyperparameter tuning is optionally applied to improve model 
performance, and results before and after tuning are compared to select
the best model.
